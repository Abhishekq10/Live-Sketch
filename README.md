# Live-Sketch
A simple notebook that uses Open CV to create a live sketch from your web cam feed

Only basic requirement would be an OpenCV installation with python 3.5+, regardless of Anaconda or Python
Most likely no effect of changing OS or machines, unless some prior bindin interrupts the process.
all additional depedencies like numpy should be collected with the same.

You can always play around with values on filters to get denser or lighter sketch depending upon the changes.
Also, you can replace the threshold filter with THRESH_BINARY to obtain a white on black sketch
